# DAOWork Development Plan

## Project Overview

DAOWork is a specialized skill-sharing marketplace designed for DAO contributors, Web3 consultants, and crypto professionals. The platform connects experts in governance, legal structuring, smart contract development, and tokenomics with DAOs in need of specialized services. Built with Next.js 14, NeonDB, and AI-powered matching, DAOWork simplifies the hiring process by enabling crypto-native payments, automating agreements with OpenLaw templates, and leveraging AI to match freelancers with the right opportunities.

## Development Timeline

MVP target completion: March 11, 2025

- **March 5-7**: Designing and developing all UI components and static pages.
- **March 9-10**: Implementing backend logic, NeonDB setup, and API integration.
- **March 11**: Final testing, bug fixes, deployment on Vercel, and open-source release.

## Frontend Development Strategy

### 1. Page Structure & Information Architecture

**Key Pages:**

- **Homepage** - Platform overview, value proposition, and call-to-action
- **Authentication** - Login/signup with Web3 wallet integration
- **User Profiles**
  - Freelancer profiles highlighting Web3 skills, experience, and past work
  - DAO/organization profiles showcasing needs and projects
- **Project Marketplace**
  - Browsable listings with filtering capabilities
  - Detailed project views
- **Skill/Service Directory** - Categorized by Web3 domains (governance, tokenomics, etc.)
- **Dashboard**
  - For freelancers: Active projects, applications, earnings
  - For DAOs: Posted projects, applicants, ongoing work
- **Messaging/Communication** - Secure communication between parties
- **Payment/Escrow System** - UI for crypto payments and contract milestones
- **Documentation/Resources** - Guides on using the platform, templates

### 2. Component Architecture

**Design System:**

- Create a modular component library with Web3-native aesthetics
- Establish consistent typography, color palette, and spacing system
- Build reusable UI components like buttons, cards, forms, modals

**Key Components:**

- Navigation (header/footer)
- Profile cards and detailed views
- Project listing cards
- Search and filter interfaces
- Wallet connection components
- Rating/review modules
- Payment/transaction visualizations

### 3. Technical Implementation

**Next.js 14 Approach:**

- Leverage App Router for enhanced routing capabilities
- Implement Server Components where appropriate for improved performance
- Use Client Components for interactive elements requiring client-side state
- Set up API routes structure for future backend integration
- Implement static site generation for public-facing pages
- Configure dynamic paths for user/project specific pages

**Styling Approach:**

- Tailwind CSS as the core utility-first CSS framework
- DaisyUI for pre-built, customizable UI components
- Custom theme configuration for Web3/DAO-specific aesthetics
- Responsive design system with mobile-first approach

**State Management:**

- Context API for app-wide state
- React Query for data fetching and caching (preparation for backend)
- Use of local storage/cookies for persisting minimal necessary information

### 4. Development Process

**Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1-2)**

- Set up Next.js 14 project structure
- Implement design system and base components
- Create layout templates and navigation
- Configure styling approach (Tailwind/CSS Modules/Styled Components)

**Phase 2: Core Pages (Day 2-4)**

- Build static versions of all primary pages
- Implement responsive layouts
- Create form UIs for user input (profiles, project creation)

**Phase 3: Interactivity (Day 5-6)**

- Add client-side interactivity (filtering, searching)
- Implement wallet connection UI
- Create mockup of payment flows
- Build UI for messaging system

**Phase 4: Preparing for Backend (Day 7)**

- Set up API route structure
- Create loading/error states for all data-dependent components
- Implement data fetch patterns with mock data

### 5. Special Considerations for Web3

- **Wallet Integration UI** - Seamless connection experience
- **Transaction Visualization** - Clear UI for crypto payment flows
- **Security Indicators** - Visual cues for secure actions
- **Governance Interfaces** - Specialized UI for DAO governance processes
- **AI-Matching Visualization** - How the platform suggests matches

### 6. Testing & Quality Assurance

- Component-level testing
- Responsive design testing across device sizes
- Accessibility checks (WCAG compliance)
- Performance monitoring (Core Web Vitals)
- User flow testing with simulated interactions

## Backend Development Strategy

### 1. Database Design (NeonDB)

**Core Tables:**

- Users (freelancers and DAO representatives)
- Projects/Jobs
- Skills/Categories
- Applications
- Contracts/Agreements
- Payments/Transactions
- Messages
- Reviews/Ratings

### 2. API Architecture

- RESTful API design for core CRUD operations
- GraphQL consideration for complex data fetching
- Authentication endpoints with Web3 wallet integration
- Webhook structure for transaction events

### 3. Web3 Integration

- Wallet authentication systems
- Smart contract interaction layers
- Transaction verification mechanisms
- OpenLaw template integration for automated agreements

### 4. AI Matching System

- Data collection for matching algorithm
- Skill-to-project matching logic
- Recommendation engine implementation
- Feedback loop for improving matches

## Deployment Strategy

- CI/CD pipeline setup with GitHub Actions
- Vercel deployment configuration
- Environment management (development, staging, production)
- Monitoring and analytics integration

## Post-MVP Roadmap

- Enhanced AI capabilities for job matching
- Mobile application development
- Integration with additional blockchain networks
- DAO governance tooling expansion
- Reputation system refinement
